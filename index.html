                    <h1>Making synthesis gas hydrogen and carbon monoxide</h1>
                    <p>
                        Process of gasification is a process which converts any
                        type of carbon-based raw material into fuel gas. This
                        process has originated in the nineteenth century in a
                        period which can be characterized by its burgeoning
                        industrial revolution and thirst for sustainable energy
                        solutions. Sir William Grove’s foundational works in the
                        1830s laid bedrock for introduction of previously
                        mentioned process, which became a later reason for
                        synthetic gas production as Franz Fishcer and Hans
                        Tropsch have refined gasification process techniques and
                        integrated catalytic processes into it. In the beginning
                        of twentieth century facilities dedicated to production
                        of syngas for lighting and head have started opening as
                        its industrial utilization has been figured out. It was
                        a combustible gas so in the start of WW2 its
                        significance arose as it started being used as an
                        alternative for gasoline due to its scarcity. Half
                        million of german cars have been powered on this gas and
                        it was starting to get used more widely in the world
                        which led to investment into technologies and production
                        of it hence leading to advancements in this field.
                        Therefore, the latter part of the twentieth century had
                        a renewed focus on syngas, in the exploration of cleaner
                        and more sustainable energy alternatives. It started
                        being created through different ways like steam
                        reforming of methane, partial oxidation of natural
                        gases, and coal gasification. The ongoing pursuit of
                        cleaner energy sources made its role in the world
                        crucial as it linked conventional and renewable energy
                        sources, helped to reduce carbon emissions, increased
                        accessibility of energy in all areas, and was used to
                        manage wastes.

                <p>
                    There are two equations for this process which can be seen
                    in the figure above: steam reforming, Boudouard reaction,
                    and water-gas shift reaction. Now let’s stop on each if
                    these one by one.
                </p>

                <p>Steam reforming:</p>
                <img src="assets/Снимок экрана 2025-01-26 205747.png" alt="" />

                <p>Conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Temperature in range of 700 to 1000 degrees celsius</li>
                    <li>3 to 25 MPa pressure</li>
                    <li>Nickel based catalyst</li>
                    <li>3:1 to 4:1 steam-methane</li>
                </ul>
                <hr />

                <p>
                    That high temperature is the optimal amount to break bonds
                    between methane and steam so for a fast rated reaction it is
                    needed to have this level of temperature. higher pressure
                    increases the density of molecules and accordingly increases
                    the rate of reaction as collisionы will occur more oftenly,
                    nickel significantly increases the rate and efficiency of
                    reaction and steam to methane ratio is important to ensure
                    that there is enough steam for reaction.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                    In steam reforming of methane, naturally derived
                    methane(CH₄) and water vapor(H₂O) which is purified water,
                    act as the initial reactants. The reaction produces hydrogen
                    (H₂), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and
                    unreacted methane. Hydrogen is cleaned in processes by using
                    Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA), membrane separation, or
                    cryogenic distillation. While carbon monoxide can be
                    generated and reformed for producing additional hydrogen in
                    the form of the water-gas shift reaction, and carbon dioxide
                    is removed in processes through amine scrubbing or cryogenic
                    separation. Methane is recycled and removed in unreacted
                    form. Water vapor is condensed and cleaned for reuse. All
                    these processes yield efficient extraction and purification
                    of syngas for use in industries.

                <h2>Environment</h2>
                <p>
                    What if the likely effect on the economy and environment?
                    Making syngas via gasification impacts both the economy and
                    environment, new studies say. Environmentally, producing
                    syngas via biomass and trash can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
                    emissions by 50–70% in relation to burning conventional
                    fuels, as it reduces methane emissions from trash and
                    utilizes CO₂ in processes (Bachmann et al., 2023). For
                    example, bio-waste gasification generates 1.2 kg CO₂ eq./kg
                    of syngas, much less compared to 3.5 kg CO₂ eq./kg for
                    syngas produced via coal (Ayodele et al., 2019).
                    Nevertheless, one of its potential drawdowns is that
                    increased biomass gasification will cause competition for
                    land and additional particulate matter emissions through a
                    15% chance in case of competition with agricultural foods
                    (Whitney H., 2024).
                </p>
                <h2>Economics</h2>
                <p>
                    Economically, producing syngas assists with having
                    alternative sources of energy. The worldwide syngas market
                    will expand at a 12.45% annual pace between 2024 and 2032,
                    with additional demand for hydrogen and artificial fuels
                    (Whitney H., 2024). In addition, when biomass gasification
                    is paired with electrolysis, it can enhance energy
                    efficiency—reaching 74.1%, in contrast with 64.8% for
                    natural gas—and reduce demand for imported fuels,
                    particularly in regions with abundance in biomass (Muhammad,
                    H. J. et al., 2022). On the contrary, high expenses in
                    erecting steam methane reforming (SMR) factories, with a
                    price tag of up to $600 million, and fluctuations in natural
                    gas price make producing syngas not economically viable in
                    the absence of subsidies (Zahir, B. & Marianne, S. E.,
                    2022). In summary, advantages and disadvantages are:
                </p>

                <h1>Environmental Consequences</h1>
                <h3 class="pros">Advantages:</h3>
                <p>
                    - Reduced GHG Emissions: Syngas produced via biomass and
                    trash reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50–70% in
                    relation to burning conventional fuels (Bachmann et al.,
                    2023). - Lower Warming Impact Globally: Biomass gasification
                    produces syngas with a global warming potential (GWP) of 1.2
                    kg CO₂ eq./kg, a much lower value compared to GWP for syngas
                    produced through coal (Ayodele et al., 2019).
                </p>
                <h3 class="cons">Disadvantages:</h3>
                <p>
                    - Land-Use and Environmental Contamination Challenges:
                    Biomass gasification can cause additional land-use concerns
                    and a 15% increase in particulate matter emissions when
                    competing with agricultural lands (Ayodele et al., 2019).
                </p>

                <h1>Economic Impact</h1>
                <h3 class="pros">Advantages:</h3>
                <p>
                    - Energy and Expanded Market Diversification: Demand for
                    syngas will expand at a 12.45% annual rate between 2024 and
                    2032, contributing to diversity in sources of energy
                    (Whitney H., 2024). - Higher Energy Efficiency: Biomass
                    gasification and electrolysis have an efficiency level of
                    74.1%, and for natural gas, it is 64.8%, conserving imported
                    fuel (Muhammad, H. J. et al., 2022).
                </p>
                <h3 class="cons">Disadvantages:</h3>
                <p>
                    - High Capital Costs and Volatile Fluctuating Flows of
                    Fluctuating Costs for Natural Gas: It takes significant
                    investments (of up to $600 million) to build SMR factories,
                    and fluctuations in the price of natural gas can make
                    profitable production of syngas challenging in the absence
                    of government incentives (Zahir, B. & Marianne, S. E.,
                    2022). In the future, producing additional syngas will rely
                    on new catalysts and technology in electrolysis. Research
                    indicates that new solid-oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs)
                    can produce cleaner syngas and save 20% in terms of energy
                    (Bachmann et al., 2023). Researchers have started testing
                    catalysts such as nickel-ceria-zirconia for enhancing
                    reforming and cutting down costs by 15% (Muhammad, H. J. et
                    al., 2022). With new technology, production can become less
                    costly and utilize more syngas in carbon-neutral fuels. For
                    the environment, utilizing additional bio-waste and mill gas
                    in production can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% in
                    2030, but studies must target water consumption and toxicity
                    (Ayodele et al., 2019). To promote development, having
                    policies that integrate research with efficient programs for
                    converting waste to energy is critical.
